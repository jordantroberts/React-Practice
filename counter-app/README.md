# Counter App - React Tutorial

A tutorial to create a counter app (which uses similar code to what you might use building a website with a shopping cart for example - adding and deleting items to a basket and displaying the total number of items in your basket).

I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0">this</a> YouTube tutorial throughout.

The purpose of this was to improve my knowledge and understanding of React, which I am completely new to.

## Using this application

1. Clone this repo.
